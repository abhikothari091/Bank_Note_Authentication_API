# Bank Note Authentication with FastAPI

This project is an end-to-end implementation of a bank note authentication system using FastAPI for the API deployment. The project includes data preprocessing, model training using Random Forest, and deployment of the model with FastAPI to provide real-time predictions.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the bank note authentication dataset.
2. **Model Training**: Training a Random Forest classifier to distinguish between authentic and fake bank notes.
3. **API Deployment**: Using FastAPI to deploy the model and create API endpoints for real-time predictions.
